While I (PrintOmnivore20) am the one publishing this, credits really have to go out to Faris (faristheancient) and qwint for their efforts in helping me not only learn everything but also implement it.

Also thanks mewlif for being the original person to start the GameMaker integration train.

Note: this project will not work on GameMaker versions older than v2.2.1. GameMaker did not support webhook integration until this point, which is weird.
Some parts also call for the function "struct_exists()" which is a function that did not exist until v2023.8.x.xx. You can remove them if need be, as they are not important; just crash protection.
This is also untested with platforms other than Windows, they SHOULD work? Hopefully? GX.Games MIGHT need some extra help, but that's up to you to find out.

I don't recommend trying to implement AP support into your game if you don't know how GameMaker works. You can very easily learn AP's API using the docs, though. Don't be discouraged if this is your first game with AP! This was mine, somehow.

I also don't ask for credits in your game by any means, the fact that this project is even in fruition is astounding. I never thought in a million years I would be able to do this in GML.
All I ask is that you ping me (theoriginalprint) in the Archipelago Discord server with your game, and I will happily playtest it for you.

P.S. This shouldn't be a drag and drop solution to every game's need. I don't want you to be limited by the already limited sample. This is just a project to give you a rough estimate on what you need to get started.
